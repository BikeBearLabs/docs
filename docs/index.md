# Rawr!

Welcome to the Bike Bear docs! On this site, we keep the DIY processes of maintaining your shiny new website.

## Getting Started

Let's start with picking what your site is built with to navigate you to the correct guide:

* [Wordpress](category/wordpress)
* Something else? [Email us](mailto:roar@bikebear.com.my).

## Having a Problem?

We're here to help! If you're having trouble with your website, please reach out to us at [roar@bikebear.com.my](mailto:roar@bikebear.com.my) and we can either point you in the correct direction, or set up a time to chat about your website and subscribe-able plans for maintenance.
