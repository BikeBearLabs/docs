# Logging in to the WordPress Dashboard

To log in to the WordPress dashboard, follow these steps:

<ol>

<li>
## **Access the Login Page**
</li>

Open your web browser and navigate to the login page of your WordPress website. The default URL for the login page is typically `http://yoursite.com/wp-login.php` or `http://yoursite.com/wp-admin`.

<li>
## **Enter Username and Password**
</li>

On the login page, you'll see fields to enter your username or email address and your password. Type in the username or email address associated with your WordPress account, followed by your password.

<li>
## **Click "Log In"**
</li>

After entering your credentials, click the "Log In" button.

<li>
## **Access the Dashboard**
</li>

If the credentials are correct, you will be redirected to the WordPress dashboard, where you can manage your website's content, appearance, plugins, users, and more.

<li>
## **Bookmark the Dashboard URL**
</li>

To make it easier to access the dashboard in the future, you can bookmark the login page URL in your web browser.

<li>
## **Two-Factor Authentication (Optional)**
</li>

If your WordPress site has two-factor authentication enabled, you may be prompted to enter a secondary code after entering your username and password. This code is typically generated by an authenticator app or sent to you via email or SMS.

If you've forgotten your password, you can click the "Lost your password?" link on the login page to reset it. You'll need access to the email associated with your WordPress account to complete the password reset process.
