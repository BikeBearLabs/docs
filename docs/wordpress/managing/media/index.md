The media library is a central repository of all the media of your site. You can upload new files to WordPress for your content by placing it in the media library. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. ## Navigate to the Media Library

	Once logged in, look for the "Media" option in the left sidebar of the WordPress admin panel.
Hover over "Media" and click on "Library."

1. ## Compress Files for Website Optimization (Optional)

	Before uploading files to WordPress, it's a good practice to compress them to optimize website performance.
Use online tools or image compression software to reduce the file size without significantly compromising image quality.
Compressing files, especially images, helps in reducing load times and improving website speed, which is crucial for user experience and SEO.

1. ## Upload Files
	In the Media Library, you'll see an "Add New" button at the top. Click on it.
You can either drag and drop files into the designated area or click on the "Select Files" button to browse your computer and select the files you want to upload.
Select the file(s) you want to upload from your computer and click "Open" (or your system's equivalent).
WordPress will start uploading the file(s) to your media library. You'll see a progress bar indicating the upload status.

1. ## Check the Resolution of the Image

	After uploading an image, you might want to check its resolution.
Click on the uploaded image to view additional details.
In the image details section, you can find information such as dimensions (width x height) and file size.
Use this information to ensure the image meets your resolution requirements.

1. ## Edit File Details (Optional)

	Once the upload is complete, you can click on the uploaded file to view additional details.
You can edit details like the title, caption, alt text, description, and more by clicking on the "Edit" button below the file details.

1. ## Inserting Files into Posts or Pages

	After uploading, you can easily insert the uploaded files (images, documents, etc.) into your posts or pages.
When creating or editing a post or page, place your cursor where you want to insert the file.
Click on the "Add Media" button above the editor.
In the media library popup, select the file you want to insert.
Customize the attachment display settings if needed.
Click the "Insert into post" button.

1. ## Ensure Proper Naming to Avoid Conflict with Permalink

	When uploading files, ensure that you give them proper names to avoid conflicts with permalinks.
Use descriptive names that reflect the content of the file.
Avoid special characters, spaces, or symbols in the file names.
WordPress will automatically generate a permalink based on the file name, so a descriptive name can help improve SEO and user experience.

1. ## Viewing and Managing Files

	You can view and manage all your uploaded files by going to "Media" > "Library."
From here, you can search, filter, edit, or delete files as needed.
To delete a file, simply hover over it and click the "Delete Permanently" link.

By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively upload files to your WordPress website using the media library, check the resolution of images, ensure proper naming to avoid permalink conflicts, and manage your media files efficiently.
