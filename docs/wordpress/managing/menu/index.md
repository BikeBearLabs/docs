# Updating Menus

Updating a menu in WordPress is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide:

:::info
Before we start, make sure you've successfully [logged in to your WordPress Dashboard](wordpress/introduction/auth/index.md) & are navigated into it.
:::

1. ## Navigate to the Menu Editor

	Once logged in, go to "Appearance" in the left-hand menu, then click on "Menus." This will take you to the Menu Editor screen.

1. ## Select the Menu to Update

	If you have multiple menus, choose the one you want to update from the drop-down menu at the top of the page.

1. ## Add or Remove Items

	To add items to your menu, you can choose from various options such as pages, posts, custom links, or categories from the left-hand column. Check the items you want to add and click "Add to Menu." To remove items, simply click on the arrow next to the item name to expand its options, then click "Remove."

1. ## Arrange Menu Items

	You can arrange the items by dragging and dropping them into the desired order. Sub-items (child items) can be nested under parent items by dragging them slightly to the right beneath the parent item.

1. ## Customize Menu Item Settings (optional)

	Click on the arrow next to each menu item to expand its settings. Here, you can customize the navigation label (the text displayed on the menu), title attribute, CSS classes, and link relationship (for custom links).

1. ## Save Changes

	Once you've made the necessary updates to your menu, click the "Save Menu" button to save your changes.

1. ## Preview Changes (optional)

	You can preview your website to see how the updated menu will look to visitors before making it live. Click the "Preview" button at the top of the Menu Editor screen.

1. ## Publish Changes

	If you're satisfied with the changes, click the "Publish" button to make the updated menu live on your website.

That's it! Your menu should now be updated with the changes you've made. Visitors to your site will see the updated menu reflecting the modifications you've implemented.
