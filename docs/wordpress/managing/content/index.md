# Updating Page Content

You can update your page content very easily using WordPress as your Content Management System (CMS). Here is a basic run-down of how you can achieve it:

:::info
Before we start, make sure you've successfully [logged in to your WordPress Dashboard](wordpress/introduction/auth/index.md) & are navigated into it.
:::

1. ## Edit Page

	Navigate to the page, and within the black background top menu bar at the top of the screen, locate and click on the 'Edit' button. This action will immediately take you to the page editor, providing you with the ability to modify all content within the page.

1. ## Using Muffin Builder

	The WordPress site has been constructed using the 'BeTheme' theme, which incorporates the 'Muffin Builder' WordPress builder. This theme and builder combination offers a versatile and user-friendly platform for designing and customizing the website's layout and content.

	Within a WordPress page, the structure is organized into sections, each containing one or multiple wraps. Inside a wrap, you can find one or many columns, and within these columns, various elements such as HTML code, shortcodes, copywriting, images, and more can be added. This modular and hierarchical structure, facilitated by the 'BeTheme' and 'Muffin Builder,' allows for a flexible and dynamic arrangement of content on your webpage.

1. ## Editing copywritting

	To edit the copywriting within a column, simply click on the pencil icon, serving as the edit button. You can then modify the text directly within the HTML code. However, exercise caution and refrain from altering any HTML code if you lack familiarity with HTML to avoid unintended issues.

	For instance, you should only modify the text within the highlighted section shown in the screenshot. Once you've made the necessary changes, click on "Save Changes," and subsequently, update the page by clicking on the "Update" button.

1. ## Editing BeTheme shortcode

	The orange text inside the editor represents the BeTheme pre-built shortcode. Essentially, this shortcode serves as a convenient shortcut provided by the theme to enable users to insert items within a column. Primarily, it is utilized for adding images and buttons. To edit the shortcode, click on it until a pencil icon appears. Click on the icon, adjust the values in the settings, and then update the changes.

1. ## Cloning & Hiding sections (optional)

	If you're concerned about potentially breaking the page, consider cloning the section you wish to edit first and then hiding it. This process serves as a backup for the existing section, offering a valuable safety net for reverting back to the previous version or referring to it if needed.
