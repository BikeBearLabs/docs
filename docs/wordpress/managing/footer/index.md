# Updating the Footer

Updating the footer in WordPress typically involves editing your theme's footer file or using a widgetized area if your theme supports it. Here's how you can update the footer:

Before we start, make sure you've successfully [logged in to your WordPress Dashboard](wordpress/introduction/auth/index.md) & are navigated into it.

<ol>

<li>
## Navigate to the Theme Editor
</li>

Go to "Appearance" in the left-hand menu, then click on "Theme Editor." Alternatively, if you're using a page builder or a theme with a footer widget area, you can navigate to "Appearance" > "Widgets."

<li>
## Find the Footer File or Widget Area
</li>

In the Theme Editor, look for a file named `footer.php` or something similar. This file controls the content of your theme's footer. If you're using a widgetized footer, navigate to the Widgets area and look for the Footer Widget section.

<li>
## Edit the Footer Content
</li>

### If you're editing the footer via the theme editor

Locate the code that corresponds to the footer section and make your changes directly in the code editor. You can add text, links, images, or any other HTML content to customize your footer.

### If you're using a widgetized footer

You can drag and drop widgets from the available widgets section into the Footer Widget area. You might have widgets for text, custom HTML, recent posts, social media icons, etc. Arrange the widgets as needed to customize your footer.

<li>
## Save Changes
</li>

After making your updates, click the "Update File" button if you're editing the footer file directly. If you're using widgets, simply close the widget editor, and your changes will be saved automatically.

<li>
## Preview Changes (optional)
</li>

You can preview your website to see how the updated footer looks before making it live. Click the "Preview" button at the top of the Theme Editor or Widgets screen.

<li>
## Publish Changes
</li>

If you're satisfied with the changes, your updated footer is ready to go live. There's no separate publish button for this; changes are saved immediately.

<li>
## Check Your Website
</li>

Visit your website in a new browser tab to see the updated footer in action. Make sure everything looks and functions as intended. 

</ol>

That's it! You've successfully updated your WordPress footer. Depending on your theme and customization options, the process may vary slightly, but these steps should cover most scenarios.
